In the domain of e-learning, the precise prediction of student performance remains a critical objective. Previous studies have utilized machine learning techniques grounded in student attributes to address this challenge; however, these approaches often grapple with the inherent complexities of high-dimensional data and significant biases. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel methodology that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the prediction of performance outcomes. The cornerstone of our approach is the development of a weighted student network (WSN), generated through the projection of a student-result bipartite graph. This innovative method uncovers latent associations, such as the identification of student clusters or communities based on diverse parameters. The subsequent construction of prediction models employs GNN-based strategies, which yield robust student-result representations that are instrumental in performance forecasting. These representations are derived from the rich information encapsulated within the WSN.
Our empirical evaluation, utilizing real-world performance data, demonstrates that our Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based model achieves exceptional accuracy, with 94.61% for grade prediction and 90.38% for dropout prediction. Moreover, visualizations using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) techniques reinforce the coherence of the GNN-based models across both prediction tasks, affirming the discriminatory capabilities of our framework. Ultimately, this proposed paradigm offers substantial potential for educational practitioners, enabling the provision of targeted interventions for students who are at risk of underperformance or attrition.
