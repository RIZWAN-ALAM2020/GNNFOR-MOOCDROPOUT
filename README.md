In an e-learning context, performance prediction is crucial. Existing studies that use machine learning approaches based on student characteristics meet this condition, however they suffer from high dimensional data difficulties and a high level of bias. To overcome these difficulties, we present a system for forecasting performance using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To develop a weighted student network (WSN), we start by projecting a student-result bipartite graph. This isolates the latent association between students. The prediction models are then built using GNN-based approaches.
The findings suggest that our system improves performance prediction accuracy. The model incorporating attention mechanisms has a performance prediction accuracy of 93.49 percent and a dropout prediction accuracy of 89.15 percent.
These models construct strong student representations for performance prediction using information collected from WSN. We use performance outcomes and drop-out risk to compare GNN-based models to baseline machine learning approaches. Furthermore, the pattern for the two cohorts is visible in the display of the last hidden layers of the network WSN, confirming the framework's discriminative capability. The proposed framework can assist teachers in providing additional support to students who are at danger of failing or dropping out of a class.
